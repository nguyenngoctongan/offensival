Offensive language detection has recently become a very important natural language processing task. However, this task poses a challenge for the automatic process due to the complexity of the natural language constructs, especially language used on social media. In this project, I attempted to create an automatic offensive language detection system using LSTM architecture and extracted features at different conceptual levels.

To use the program, clone the repository. Download the train and test data from the official website of SEMIVAL 2019 competition, task 6 (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011) and unzip the data under "DATA" folder.
Run python lstm.py file and input the folder contain the data from the competition and the subtask ("a" or "b")
